		<p>Tom M8te is a library that is shared across most of <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/mmdeveloper/" target="_blank">my plugins</a>. Since I work alone I need a quick way to deploy fixes or a way to make mundane development tasks a lot more streamline and thats why I built Tom M8te.</p>
		<p>Tom M8te can only be understood by a developer, if your not a web developer I apologise. However, if your plugin says that it needs Tom M8te, then you do have to install/activate Tom M8te so that it can work. If you use more then one of my plugins and experience a bug, chances are you'll be able to fix them all with the next update to Tom M8te.</p>
		<p>Tom M8te is good for creating form fields, creating datatables with search and sort functionality. Its ok with basic form validation as well. I've created a small method for adding htaccess rules and form fields for Wordpress options.</p>
		<p>I think the two best things about Tom M8te from a developer's perspective, is that you don't have to know much about Wordpress to use it and it can save a few repetitive lines of code.</p>
